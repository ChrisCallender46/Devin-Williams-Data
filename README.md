In this project, I used R to analyze Devin Williams' statistics and metrics to analyze his poor start to the 2025 season. I think that Williams will turn his season around and get back to being a great reliever. I also determined the most important metrics for pitchers are ERA, FIP, xERA, and xFIP. I researched how those metrics are calculated and the variables that impact them, such as strikeout rate, exit velocity, and ground ball rate. I used t tests to test for significance and calculated the coefficient of correlation.
